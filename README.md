<h1>Some points on the history of India</h1>

<li> The First cities </li>
<p>The story of Harappa
Very often, old buildings have a story to tell. Nearly hundred and fifty years ago, when railway lines were being laid down for the first time in Punjab, engineers stumbled upon the site of Harappa in present-day Pakistan. To them, it seemed like a mound that was a rich source of ready made, high quality bricks. So they carried off thousands of bricks from the walls of the old buildings of the city to build railway lines. Many buildings were completely destroyed.
Then, about eighty years ago, archaeologists found the site, and realised that this was one of the oldest cities in the subcontinent. As this was the first city to be discovered, all other sites from where similar buildings (and other things) were found were described as Harappan. These cities developed about 4700 years ago.</p>
<p>The Settlement Pattern of the Harappan
Civilisation
The earliest city discovered in India was of Mohen-jo-Daro in the Larkana district of Sind.
Further up, in the Indus Valley, another great city known as Harappa in Sahewal (old name :
Montgomery) district was discovered. As the chief centres of this civilisation lie round the river Indus and its tributaries, it is styled as the 'Indus Valley Civilisation'. Some historians also call it theHarappan culture because the pattern of life in all these cities resembles that of Harappa.
Excavations at other sites, such as Ropar near Chandigarh, Lothal near Ahmedabad and Kalibangan in Rajasthan prove that this civilisation flourished over a vast area, comprising the whole of Sind and the Punjab, the bulk of Kathiawar, the valley of N.W.F.P. (North West Frontier Province) and a part of the Gangetic basin.
Now it has been proved beyond doubt that the so-called Indus Valley Civilisation was also flourishing beyond the Indus valley. So the historians have begun calling this civilisation as the Indus Civilisation.<p/>
<p>Characteristics of a Civilisation
 towns and cities
 surplus food production
 trade flourishes and people specialise in various trade activities
 development of technology is prevalent
 art flourishes and many art and craft forms exist
 People communicate through language in its written and spoken form
 the society is divided into various socioeconomic segments
 law and order exists
 a government enforces this law and order.</P>

<P>Life in the city
A Harappan city was a very busy place.
There were people who planned the construction of special buildings in the city. These were probably the rulers. It is likely that the rulers sent people to distant lands to get metal, precious stones, and other things that they wanted. They may have kept the most valuable objects, such as ornaments of gold and silver, or beautiful beads, for themselves. And there were scribes, people who knew how to write, who helped prepare the seals, and perhaps wrote on other materials that have not survived.
Besides, there were men and women, craftspersons, making all kinds of things
— either in their own homes, or in special workshops. People were travelling to distant lands or returning with raw materials and, perhaps, stories. Many terracotta toys have been found and children must have played with these.</p>

<li> Janapadas And Mahajanapadas</li>
<p>How some men became rulers
Choosing leaders or rulers by voting is something that has become common during the last fifty years or so. How did men become rulers in the past? Around 3000 years ago, some men became recognised as rajas by performing big sacrifices.
The ashamedha or horse sacrifice was one such ritual. A horse was let loose to wander freely and it was guarded by the raja's men. If the horse wandered into the kingdoms of other rajas and they stopped it, they had to fight. If they allowed the horse to pass, it meant that they accepted that the raja who wanted to perform the sacrifice was stronger than them. These rajas were then invited to the sacrifice, which was performed by specially trained priests, who were rewarded with gifts. The raja who organised the sacrifice was recognised as being very powerful, and all those who came brought gifts for him.
The raja was a central figure in these rituals.
He often had a special seat, a throne or a tiger skin. His charioteer, who was his companion in the battlefield and witnessed his exploits, chanted tales of his glory. His relatives, especially his wives and sons, had to perform a variety of minor rituals.</p>
<p>Janapadas
The rajas who performed these big sacrifices wee now recognised as beind rajas of janapadas tacter than janas. The word janapada literally the land where the jana set its foot, and settled down.
Archaeologists have excavated a number of settlements in these I napadas, such as Purana Qila in Delhi, Hastinapura near Meerut, and Atranjikhera near Etah (the last two are in Uttar Pradesh). They found that people lived in huts, and kept cattle as well as other animals. They also grew a variety of crops — rice, wheat, barley, Pulse and sesame.</p>
<p>Mahajanapadas
About 2500 years ago, some janapadas became
more important than others, and were known as mahajanapadas. Some of these are shown on Map
 Most mahajanapadas had a capital city, many of these were fortified. This means that huge walls of wood, brick or stone were built around them.
Forts were probably built because people were afraid of attacks from other kings and needed</p>
<p>A little before Buddha, Northern India came to be divided into sixteen such Mahajanapadas. They were :
 Anga (now identified with the districts of Bhagalpur and Monghyr in Bihar)
 Magadha (Districts of Patna and Gaya in Bihar)
Kashi (Area around Benard)
Koshala (Awadh in Uttar Pradesh)
 Vajji (North Bihar)
 Malla (Eastern U.P.)
Chedi (Bundelkhand in Madhya Pradesh)
 Vatsa (Area around Allahabad)
 Kuru (Areas around Delhi and Meerut)
 Panchala (Rohilkhand division in U.P.)
 Matsya (Areas around Jaipur and Alwar)
 Surasena (Areas around Mathura in U.P.)
 Assaka (Godavari Valley)
 Avanti (Malwa and a part of Madhya Pradesh)
 Gandhara (Part of Afghanistan)
 Kamboj (Part of Kashmir and Afghanistan).</p>

<li>Ashoka The Great- The King Who Gave Up War </li>
<P>THE EXPANSION OF THE EMPIRE
During the period from 600 B.C. to 400 B.C. there appeared in India a few powerful kingdoms and republics. The first were smaller states known as
'Janapadas'. With the passage of time these
'Janapadas' conquered the neighbouring states and thus were formed bigger states known as
'Mahajanapadas'. A little before Buddha, northern India came to be divided into sixteen such Mahajanapadas.
With the passage of time, Magadha under Bimbisara (547 - 495 B.C.) and his son Ajatashatru
(495 - 462 B.C.) emerged as the strongest state in north India. These rulers were not only great conquerors but also great administrators; so under them Magadha progressed by leaps and bounds.
Under the next rulers, i.e. Nandas, especially Mahapadma Nanda, Magadha continued its progress further. When Alexander invaded India in
326 B.C. Magadha was being ruled by a Nanda ruler, Dhana Nan</P>
<P>Chandragupta Maurya and Expansion of the Empire : Making the best use of the confusion which prevailed in Punjab after the death of Alexander, young Chandragupta Maurya, with the help of his companion and guru Chanakya (or Kautilya), drove the Greeks out of Punjab and conquered it in 322 B.C. In the next year, making the best use of the unpopularity of the last Nanda ruler, Dhana Nanda, he conquered Magadha in 321 B.C. Then he never looked back and added one territory after another to his state. He soon transformed it into a vast empire. In
305 B.C. when Seleucus, a Greek general, invaded ndia, Chandragupta Maurya defeated him. Seleucus not only surrendered the four provinces of Herat, Kandahar, Kabul and Baluchistan, but he also had to
IS
give his daughter in marriage to the Mauryan ruler.
Encouraged by his success in the North, e Chandragupta Maurya is credited to have won I many southern states as well. Thus, Chandragupta Maurya laid the foundation of a vast empire, which extended from Bengal in the east to the Hindukush in the west and from the Himalayas in the north to Mysore in the south. Chandragupta was also a great administrator.
After Chandragupta Maurya, his son Bindusara ruled for some years (298-273 B.C.) but not much is known about his reign. After him, his illustrious son Ashoka succeeded him.
After the Mauryan empire, many empires were established in India but the credit of establishing the first historical empire in India goes to the
Mauryas, especially to
Chandragupta Maurya.</P>
<P>Military Administration — Chandragupta maintained a huge army of 6,00,000 infantry, 30,000 cavalry, 9,000 elephants and
8,000 chariots. Besides, there was an efficient network of spy system. These spies kept the emperor informed about all the important matters.</P>
<P>ASHOKA'S ACCESSION TO THE THRONE
Ashoka is regarded as one of the most popular rulers of ancient India. He belonged to the Mauryan dynasty. He was born in about 302 B.C. During Bindusara's reign, he served as the governor of Taxila and Ujjain and thus got enough experience of administration. He succeeded to the throne after his father's death in 273 B.C. But his coronation ceremony was held four years later in 269 B.C.
Probably the delay of four years was due to the war of succession in which Ashoka defeated his elder brother Susima and assumed the title of 'Devanam Priya' (The Beloved of the Gods) and 'Priyadarshi' (The Handsome Looking).</P>
<img src="ashoka empire.jpg"height="500" width="600">
<P>The Kalinga War, 261 B.C., and Further Expansion of the Mauryan Empire
The conquest of Kalinga by Ashoka was perhaps the most important event of his reign.
Ashoka had inherited a vast empire from his grandfather and father but Kalinga, the modern province of Orissa and Ganjam district, was not yet in his empire. Ashoka, who believed in the traditional policy of conquests and aggression, could not tolerate the existence of an independent state on the borders of his empire. Thus, Ashoka invaded this territory in 261 B.C. The Kalinga people offered tough resistance but they were ultimately overpowered by the mighty Mauryan army. From Rock Edict XIII, we come to know that the Kalinga people suffered much and as many as one hundred and fifty thousand persons were captured, one hundred thousand were slain and many times that number died.</P>
<p>Results of the Kalinga War
Death and destruction in Kalinga made Ashoka unhappy. It became a turning point in his life and he became the first monarch in the world history to abandon the path of war and violence. For the next thirty years that he ruled, he never went to war and became an ardent follower of the Buddha.
Upagupta, who was his Guru, introduced him to Buddhism. Thereafter, Ashoka gave up his ambition of 'Digvijay' or Victory in All Directions' and pursued a policy of 'Dharmavijay'.
Ashoka's empire was very vast. It extended from the Brahmaputra in the east to the Hindukush in the north-west and the Arabian Sea in the west and from the Himalayas in the north to river Pennar in the south. Some portions of Nepal and Kashmir also formed a part of Ashoka's empire. Outside India, it included the provinces of Kabul, Herat and Kandahar. It was thus the biggest empire in ancient India.</P>

<P>Ashoka's Edicts and Inscriptions
Most of our knowledge about Ashoka's reign is obtained from his Rock
Edicts and Inscriptions.
His edicts were inscribed in Prakrit and not in Sanskrit because Prakrit was the language of the people in those days.
About 30 km from Gaya, the 'Ajivika Caves' have been discovered on the Barabar Hills. They are so called because they were dedicated to the 'Ajivika' thinkers who were contemporaries of Mahavira and Buddha. These caves bear inscriptions on their walls.</P>
<img src="lion capital.png"height="600" width="550">
<P> Ashoka's Place in History
Ashoka occupies
an important place in the
history of India. He is regarded as one of the greatest rulers of India. Like Alexander, he was a great conqueror but gave up fighting for a cause.
In addition, Ashoka raised Buddhism from a local sect to a world religion. Ashoka followed the policy of religious tolerance. In one of his edicts, he says, "There should not be honour to one's own sect or condemnation to another sect; on the contrary, other sects should be honoured. By doing so, one promotes one's own sect and benefits another sect."
Not only this, Ashoka gave the best administration to his subjects. He treated them like his own children and was always ready to serve them. Not for men alone but for animals too, hospitals were opened. In fact, there was all round development during his reign. That is why historians shower praise upon Ashoka.</P>



<li>Life in Towns and Villages</li>
<P>LIFE IN THE VILLAGES
Although there was no dearth of urban centres
— coastal towns, capitals and religious centres in India during the early phase of the Indian history
(600 B.C. to 300 A.D.) — this country has always been predominantly a land of villages, and still it maintains this rural trait.</P>
<P>Who Lived in the Villages
Naturally the agricultural classes formed the
major part of the village population. They included the landowners, the ploughmen and the landless labourers, including slaves, who were known by different names in the southern and northern parts of the country. The largest landowner in the village was named as 'Grama Bhojak in northern part of the country and 'vellalar' in the southern part of the country, particularly in Tamil Naidu. The king often assigned him the duty of collecting the land revenue. He was all in all in his village, himself as a policeman and himself as a judge. A village samiti was appointed for his help. There was also many craftspersons in the villages like the blacksmiths, potters, weavers and carpenters etc.
The people in the villages fully cooperated with each other and lived in peace. They discussed their affairs in the open. They co-operated with one another to build roads, parks and public places.
Villages were linked with one another by roads and waterways. Corn, cotton, sugarcane, fruit and vegetables were grown. Forced labour was nol known at all.</P>
<P>LIFE IN THE CITIES
During this period many towns and cities also flourished. According to historians, this period saw the Second Urbanisation.
The Second Urbanisation
The first urbanisation in India began during the Harappan period. It came to an end with the advent of the Aryans in 1500 B.C. Being the rural folk, the Aryans destroyed the Harappan towns one by one, which remained extinct during the next 1000 years.
We again hear of the new towns and cities during the age of the Buddha in the 6th century
B.C. That is why the period from the 6th century B.C. to the 4th century B.C. or the age of the Buddha is known as the second urbanisation in India. Towns like Kausambhi, Shravasti, Ayodhya, Kapilvastu, Vaishali, Rajgir (Rajgriha), Pataliputra etc. flourished during this period.</P>
<P>Literary Sources
Among the literary sources the Buddhist literary works like the Jatakas and the Tripitakas as well as the Sangam literature come to our help. From the stories and episodes given in these books help the historians to form an idea of the social and economic conditions of the people of those days.
But they also get a lot of information about the different towns and cities and their relations with the surrounding villages.</P>
<img src="sculpture.jpg"height="650" width="550">
<P>Coins
Coins, used for measuring money, have proved very useful in solving many chronological puzzles.
They corroborate and sometimes modify the information received from literature. These coins are our only source of information with regard to the Bactrian and Indo-Greek rulers. The inscriptions on these coins, both in Greek and Kharoshthi, clearly indicate that these rulers must have ruled over northern India. Similarly, these coins throw remarkable light on the personal accomplishment of certain rulers (e.g., Samudragupta) and also on the religious views of others (e.g., Kanishka).
Samudragupta's coins having the Vehicle of Vishnu inscribed on them, clearly indicate that he was a devotee of that deity; others with Vina attest his love for music. These coins are of various metals - gold, silver, copper or alloy (mixture of two or more metals). The metal used and its purity undoubtedly reflect the economic condition of the country at that time. Their discovery at different places helps us in fixing the extent of various kingdoms in ancient India.</P>
<img src="coin.jpg"height="500" width="650">
<P>Cities of Different Kinds and Many
Functions
As already said, there were many cities and towns flourishing between the 6th century B.C. to the 4th century A.D. Some of the most important were those of Kausambhi, Shravasti, Ayodhya, Kapilvastu, Rajgir, Pataliputra, Mathura etc.
All these towns and cities were flourishing and had some characteristic features of their own. They had planned layouts, regular roads and streets, public drains, fortifications, temples, monasteries, elegant residences of the nobility and the royalty etc. In the beginning, the towns were very small in size but with the passage of time they grew in size as well as in numbers. Particularly, when a town became the capital of some ruler, it grew both in size and importance. Sometimes, when some traders or craftsmen lived in a particular town, soon became important as a centre of at particular craft or trade. Some towns became popular as coastal towns while others became famous as religious centres. In the contemporary literature we find a number of these flourishing towns. Some of the most important were Mathura, Pataliputra, Ujjaini, Pratishthana, Bhrigukachha, Tamralipti, Shravasti, Champa, Rajgriha, Ayodhya, Kaushambi, Vaishali, Pava, Kushinagar, Bharuch, Kaveripattinam, Arikamedu etc. All these towns were centres of trade, craft, art and administration.
A brief description of any one of them, say Mathura, shall justify this point.</P>
<P>Trade and traders
You have read about the Northern Black Polished Ware. This fine pottery, especially bowls and plates, were found from several archaeological sites throughout the subcontinent. How do you think it reached these places? Traders may have carried them from the places where they were made, to sell them at other places.
South India was famous for gold, spices, especially pepper, and precious stones. Pepper was particularly valued in the Roman Empire, so much so that it was known as black gold. So, traders carried mäny of these goods to Rome in ships, across the sea, and by land in caravans.
There must have been quite a lot of trade as many Roman gold coins have been found in south India.</P>
<P>The earliest Tamil compositions
Some of the earliest works in Tamil, known as Sangam literature, were composed around 2300 years ago. These texts were called Sangam because they were supposed to have been composed and compiled in assemblies (known as sangams) of poets that were held in the city of Madurai. The Tamil terms mentioned above are found in Sangam literature.</P>
